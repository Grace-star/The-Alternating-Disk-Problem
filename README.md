# The-Alternating-Disk-Problem


The alternating disks problem is: 
Input: a positive integer n and a list of 2n disks of alternating colors light-dark, starting with light
Output: a list of 2n disks, the first n disks are light, the next n disks are dark, and an integer m representing the number of swaps to move the dark ones after the light ones.

There are two algorithms, presented below, that solve this problem in O(n2) time. 

The left-to-right algorithm
The lawnmower algorithm
